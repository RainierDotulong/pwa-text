## Description

This project involved refactoring code to create a Progressive Web App that could run offline. An app needs to fulfill several qualifications to be considered a PWA, all of which this does: it should contain manifest JSON files and a service worker, it should run offline, and it should be highly responsive and fast given it is running locally. Preferably, it will achieve its speed by caching its static assets (such as its images, JS files, etc.) and retrieving them there.
